It is the bedrock of European fucntional harmony.\n\n     In this lesson the tonic is identified by the symbol I and the dominant is identified by the symbol V. Conventional understanding is that the V chord seeks resolution to the I chord. Confirm whether or not your ears agree with that!\n\n     There are only two chord choices in this lesson -- I Major and V Major. The conventional functional identify for the I Major is IM and the conventional functional identify for V Major is VM.\n\n     Touch a measure, select the Answer Pane by touching the answer button and use the controls on the Answer Pane to select either IM or VM. Then press Select at the bottom of the Answer Pane to see if you identified the chord in the selected measure correctly."
